**Refactoring Practice**
========================
- The most important part of refactoring is _practice_
- We'll be refactoring the popular board game "Yahtzee" (original exercise created by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/marcoemrich/Refactoring-Katas))
- If you're not familiar with Yahtzee, read this overview, and check it out [online](https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/)
    - Yahtzee is a turn based dice game where you use dice to create poker hands
    - On your turn, you roll five dice at the same time; you try to use the numbers to form poker hands (like straight, pair, 3 of a kind, etc)
    - You can reroll some or all of your dice two times on your turn
    - After you're satisfied with your dice, you write down the score on your score sheet
    - You keep playing until you've used every row on your score sheet
    - There are also bonuses, but we won't be worrying about them in this project
- You will have 5 weeks to work on this project
- We'll spend 20 minutes at the end of class each week working on it together

- Remember our core goals in class design
    1. Encapsulate
    2. Delegate
    3. Program to a contract
    4. Polymorphism

- This exercise does not require you to use any specific pattern or principle; use what seems most appropriate for the situation.
